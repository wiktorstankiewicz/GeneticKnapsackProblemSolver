# GeneticKnapsackProblemSolver

GeneticKnapsackProblemSolver is a program made for my Computer Science class. It finds a solution to binary knapsack problem using a genetic algorithm.
Please be aware, that the bizzare way of handling exceptions and passing by reference instead of utilizing RVO used in the program wasn't my prefferable option, 
it was a requirement given by our teacher.
